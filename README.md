# Family Feud Web Sys

## 1. HTML Structure
We utilized HTML to create the foundational structure of our web system interface, using elements like `<div>`, `<form>`, and `<button>` to organize content and facilitate user interactions effectively. **To improve the semantic structure of our HTML, we suggest using `<section>` for grouping related content, which will enhance code readability and accessibility for screen readers.**

## 2. CSS and Bootstrap Styling
We employed CSS and Bootstrap to style our web system, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface. Bootstrapâ€™s grid system helped us make layout adjustments for different screen sizes, while our custom CSS added unique styles to elements like buttons and text. **We recommend choosing a single primary color and using it consistently across buttons and headings to create a more cohesive look and improve the visual appeal of our interface.**

## 3. JavaScript Interactivity
We implemented JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as form submissions, answer checking, and timer management in the game. By encapsulating our game logic in functions that respond to user inputs, we ensured a dynamic and engaging experience. **To further enhance user experience, we suggest adding a confirmation message when an answer is submitted, reassuring users that their input has been received and processed.**

## 4. PHP and MySQL Integration
We used PHP to manage order data and integrate with a MySQL database, allowing us to store and retrieve game-related information efficiently. Through SQL queries, we handled game state, user scores, and session data. **To enhance our database interaction security, we recommend implementing prepared statements. This improvement would protect against SQL injection attacks and strengthen the robustness of our data handling within the application.**
